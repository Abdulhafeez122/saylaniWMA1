            A tour to Kashmir is a journey filled with breathtaking beauty and deep historical significance. Known as "Paradise on Earth," Kashmir attracts tourists with its snow-covered mountains, green valleys, and serene lakes. But beyond its natural charm, Kashmir is also home to many historical sites. The famous Mughal Gardens, such as Shalimar Bagh and Nishat Bagh in Srinagar, reflect the grandeur of the Mughal era. The 14th-century Jamia Masjid stands as a masterpiece of wooden architecture and spiritual peace. Historic forts like Hari Parbat and Parimpora Fort tell the stories of ancient rulers and empires. Visiting these places gives travelers a glimpse into Kashmir's rich cultural and historical heritage. The blend of nature and history makes a Kashmir tour a truly unforgettable experience.

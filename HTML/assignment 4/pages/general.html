    <p>Sugar is a sweet-tasting substance commonly used in foods and drinks. It is a carbohydrate that provides the body
        with energy. Sugar is naturally found in fruits (as fructose) and milk (as lactose), but the most common type
        used in cooking is sucrose, which comes from sugarcane or sugar beets.

        Sugar is used to sweeten food, preserve jams, and add flavor to baked goods. While it adds taste and energy, too
        much sugar can lead to health problems like tooth decay, obesity, and diabetes, so it should be used in
        moderation.</p>

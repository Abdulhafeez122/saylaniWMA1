A shop is a place where goods or services are sold to customers. It can be small or large and may offer various items such as food, clothes, electronics, or household products. Shops play an important role in our daily lives by providing essential items conveniently. They can be found in markets, malls, or as standalone stores. Some shops are physical, while others operate online, known as e-commerce. A shopkeeper manages the shop, maintains stock, and helps customers with their purchases.

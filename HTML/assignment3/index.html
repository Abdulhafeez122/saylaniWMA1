        A shop is a place where people buy and sell goods. Shops can be small, like a corner store, or large, like a
        supermarket or shopping mall. They may sell food, clothes, electronics, books, and many other items. Shops can
        be physical (where people visit in person) or online (where people shop using the internet).

        Shops are important for daily life. They help people get the things they need, such as groceries, clothes,
        medicines, and tools. Shopkeepers manage shops and help customers with their purchases. Some shops are open
        every day, while others have fixed opening and closing times.

        In todayâ€™s world, online shops like Amazon and Daraz are also very popular, where customers can order from home
        and receive delivery at their door.
